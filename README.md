# peterplanner

PeterPlanner is a course prerequisite tracker and scheduling tool for UCI students.

This is the core script that deals with generating a JSON output containing all of the relevant content for a user. This repo also contains the functions for scraping the necessary pages from [DegreeWorks](https://www.reg.uci.edu/access/student/degreeworks/?seg=U), [UCI General Catalogue](http://catalogue.uci.edu/), [Course Prerequisites](https://www.reg.uci.edu/cob/prrqcgi), and [WebSOC (Schedule of Classes)](https://www.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc).
